Problem Statement
A retail company Abstergo Corp. has recently setup an online shopping portal(website) to sell their
products. Due to fierce competition, the company wants a solution that can reduce the time and
effort it needs to enhance the functionality of their website on a regular basis. They are looking for an
automated way to deploy the new code (for new features) to production website whenever they
want.
Business Requirements
• The team of developers working on new features will merge their code to a GitHub repo.
• As soon as the code reaches GitHub, using a CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline, setup in Jenkins,
automated builds will be triggered.
• The automated builds will frequently deploy new features to the production website.
• Every build will prepare a Dockerfile and push docker images to docker-hub.
• Every docker image will be deployed (Continuous Deployment) to a kubernetes-cluster.
Fork the given repository to your own account and use it as the application for your pipeline project

Architecture Description:

Here’s a structured text version of the DevOps pipeline and monitoring architecture from your image, formatted for clarity and machine readability:

---

## 🛠️ DevOps Pipeline and Monitoring Architecture

### 👨‍💻 Developers
- Write and commit code to a **Git** repository (Source Code Repository)

### 🔄 Continuous Integration
- **Jenkins** pulls code from Git
- Jenkins triggers builds and tests

### 📦 Continuous Deployment
- Built images are pushed to **Docker Hub** (Image Repository)
- Docker Hub serves images to the **Kubernetes Cluster**

### 📈 Continuous Monitoring
- **Prometheus** monitors:
  - Jenkins
  - Docker Hub
  - Kubernetes Cluster
- Prometheus collects **Prometheus Data Points**

### 📊 Visualization
- Prometheus sends metrics to **Grafana**
- Grafana displays data on a **Grafana Dashboard**

### ⚙️ Kubernetes Cluster
- Hosts deployed applications
- Supports **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** for autoscaling based on metrics
